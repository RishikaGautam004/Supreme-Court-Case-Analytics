The Supreme Court Case Analytics Portal is a multi-page analytical dashboard built using Power BI to explore long-term trends, behavioral patterns, and performance indicators in judicial case data.
The project focuses on transforming raw judicial datasets into meaningful insights related to case volume, disposal efficiency, judgment complexity, volatility, and system workload.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how data analytics can support policy analysis, operational planning, and performance monitoring in the judicial domain.

Page 1 — Judicial Case Overview & Disposal Performance
Purpose: To understand how the judicial system handles workload over time and identify performance trends.

Page 2 — Judgment Complexity & Structural Trends
Purpose: To analyze whether judgments are becoming longer or more complex and how structural patterns evolve over decades.
